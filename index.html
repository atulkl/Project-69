       The design brief was Interior Design for the new auditorium space “for varied types of performances” and one that can accommodate a large proportion of the 1,200 pupils. 
       Our key design aim was to ensure enough flexibility to accommodate a range of school activities and stage performances. 
        We also needed to make sure that the fixtures and fitting were durable enough to withstand expected wear and tear of a bustling school environment.
        The lighting and sound systems were designed to allow for different configurations. " </p>
